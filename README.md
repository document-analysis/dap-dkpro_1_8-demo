# dap-dkpro_1_8-demo

This repository contains merely a single Java class which demonstrates the usage of [dap-dkpro_1_8](https://github.com/document-analysis/dap-dkpro_1_8).

Note
----
**At the first time the demo runs on a fresh machine it downloads a large amount of data. It might take about 5-10 minutes in which it looks like "freeze"**. Don't be alarmed. Just let it work. At the second time it will be much faster.

Note also that you need to provide at least 2 GB heap size for it to work properly.
